# Friary Settlement Project

This project aims to glean the rationale behind why Friaries were established where they were, in the 12th to 14th centuries (I think?).

## Potential Reasons behind why Friaries were established in certain regions (hypothesized)

* The settlement site was nearby a major city/town
* The settlement was near the water
* The settlement was near a rich area
* The settlement was far away from neighbouring friaries (or maybe close to? Or close to competing orders? Unsure -- to investigate)
